The NCEI has been documenting tornadoes since 1950. Each\nyear is contained in its own dataframe before any data cleaning is done\n\nWhere the data was collected: The United Sates\n\nHow was the data generated: The National Weather Service is the main\nsource of tornado data, which they collect through their network of\nweather forecast offices\n\nStructure of the Data: .csv file\n\nFormating desicions in the data: Dates are listed as YEARMONTH: YYYYMM,\nand Days are listed as Start Day and End Day\n\nData Validation / Quality Control: This is from a government site so it\nwill hopefully be of good quality There are some missing values in the\ndata\n\nLicense: No specific license is provided\n\nHere is the dataset I chose to plot coastal data:\nhttps://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1284/title_page.html\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWho collected the Data: The data was collected by the United States\nGeological Survey\n\nWhy was the data collected: The data was collected to create a shapefile\nof 492 Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties in the United\nStates and some territories\n\nWhat the data is about: Coastline data from the United States\n\nWhen the data was collected: The data is from coastal ground conditions\nin 2009\n\nWhere the data was collected: The United Sates\n\nHow was the data generated: The CZMP counties shapefile was created\nusing a three-step process involving the 2008 TIGER/Line shapefile, a\nNOAA list of CZMP counties, and reconciliation with historical county\nchanges. In 2009, updates were made to align with the latest TIGER/Line\ndata, increasing the dataset to 492 counties and 501 polygons. The\nshapefile was further revised following Alaska's withdrawal from the\nCZMP in 2011, but Alaskan county equivalents were retained for\ngeographic reference, with a note that the data reflects 2009\nconditions.\n\nStructure of the Data: .shp file There is also a lot of other files that\nare contained in the Coastal Datasets folder in the Datasets folder\n\nFormating desicions in the data: The 'geometry' column contains shape\ndata on the latitude and longitude of the coasts that will need to be\nproperly formatted when plotting\n\nData Validation / Quality Control: This is from a government site so it\nwill hopefully be of good quality\n\nLicense: No specific license is provided From the USGS: \"The USGS is\ncommitted to and is making every possible effort to ensure that all\nelectronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained,\nor used by the USGS is accessible to people with disabilities, including\nboth our employees and the customers we serve.\"\n\nSuggested Data Analysis Methods :\n\nUse the Latitude and Longitude columns to plot the location of each\nshark When the shapefile for the coastal areas are plotted, we can see\nwhere these sharks are compared to the coastal areas Next, plot the\ntorando start points and end points are plotted and find a way to code\neach tornado to a color or shape to help identify their category\nstrength or magnitude\n\nFinally, we can see if there is a high density of tornadoes that form\nclose to the coast and also near shark infested waters that move inwards\ntowards cities\n",
