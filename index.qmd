I am a Senior at UNL graduating in December of 2025 with a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics and Data Analytics and a Minor in Mathematics. As an aspiring Biostatistician, I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights to drive informed decision-making. I love finding a way to easily clean or export data in order to prepare it for analysis!

I love to perform analysis in R, SAS, Python, and Excel, but I am also eager to expand my data analysis skills and knowledge so I can push myself to assist the best way I can. My collaborative experience has equipped me to thrive in diverse team settings, and I am excited to apply my technical abilities and problem-solving mindset to create impactful data solutions within a dynamic, adaptable team.
