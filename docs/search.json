    "text": "(Over)Analysis of Imminent Sharknados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever been worried about massive tornadoes carrying sharks through your coastal town? I analyzed tornado data from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s National Center for Environmental Information (NOAA’s NCEI), shark population from NOAA’s Southeast Fisheries Science Center (NOAA’s SEFSC), the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PAIOOS), and California’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, as well as spatial coastal data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to determine how likely such an event would occur.\nFrom start to finish: my method and final results (Also Coming Soon!)"

    "text": "I am a Senior at UNL graduating in December of 2025 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics and Data Analytics and a Minor in Mathematics. As an aspiring Biostatistician, I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights to drive informed decision-making. I love finding a way to easily clean or export data in order to prepare it for analysis!\nI love to perform analysis in R, SAS, Python, and Excel, but I am also eager to expand my data analysis skills and knowledge so I can push myself to assist the best way I can. My collaborative experience has equipped me to thrive in diverse team settings, and I am excited to apply my technical abilities and problem-solving mindset to create impactful data solutions within a dynamic, adaptable team."
