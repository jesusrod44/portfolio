During my internship at UTMB's Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science, I worked with Principal Investigator Dr. Celeste Finnerty PhD and her clinical team, as well as Biostatistician Dr. Heidi Spratt PhD analyzing de-indentified burn survivor medical records from global healthcare database TriNetX.

Have you ever been worried about massive tornadoes carrying sharks through your coastal town? I analyzed tornado data from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's National Center for Environmental Information (NOAA's NCEI), shark population from NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center (NOAA's SEFSC), the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PAIOOS), and California's Department of Fish and Wildlife, as well as spatial coastal data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to determine how likely such an event would occur.

<!-- Animation brings in a key component of analysis where the third parameter you want to animate is not directly visible in your plot. Sometimes it can tell a powerful story and sometimes it can just add some flair to an otherwise low-key story. -->

<!-- No actions were taken from the insights you produced, and there was no impact on the business. Your beautiful analysis went on to sit in a folder unseen by anybody ever again. Let's name this folder "the analysis morgue." It contains more moribund analyses than it ought to because this scenario represents a common problem with data analytics teams, and by experiencing it you are not alone. -->
